This project is a comprehensive analysis of multiplexed FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) data, based on the studies by Bintu et al. (2018) and Liu et al. (2020). The primary objectives of this project are to investigate chromatin structure, analyze pairwise probability distance distributions, and explore the scaling behavior of chromatin phases. The combined analysis of human and mouse data enhances the understanding of chromatin structure across different species, offering a comprehensive view of chromatin organization and its scaling properties. 

The project is implemented in Python and utilizes various scientific libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib for data processing, analysis, and visualization. The results provide valuable insights into the chromatin structure and its scaling laws, contributing to the understanding of chromatin organization in different cell types.
